K-App application repository


# Dev

Install project : 
```bash
npm install
```

Launch dev mode : 
```bash
npm run dev
```

It will first launch the back and then launch angular.
There will have two things :
* The server who will be available at http://localhost:3000
* The angular app who will be available at http://localhost:4200

All api requests made at the angular app will be transferred to the server.
