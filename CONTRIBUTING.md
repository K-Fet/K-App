## How to contribute to K-App

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** 
by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/K-Fet/K-App/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
 [open a new one](https://github.com/K-Fet/K-App/issues/new).
 Be sure to add an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, be sure to test your fix and follow guidelines provided by eslint & tslint.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

You can do the same as for a fix, just open a PR and 
don't forget to mention that it does not add any feature.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open an issue before doing anything

* Once we approve the change, you can start doing it or ask someone else to do it.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use K-App by opening an issue with the label `question`.
